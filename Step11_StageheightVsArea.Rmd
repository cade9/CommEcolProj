Load packages 
```{r, message = F, warning = F}

```

### Step 1: Identify Stations Corresponding to Study Areas
Using the CDEC_stageheight_FINAL2_AMILLION.shp and L8_PathAllocation_diss_Final.shp
![Example File of Stageheight Path Allocation](./Figures/shpStageheightMap.PNG)

the main station that collects stageheight information for a particular sub-region was recorded. Any secondary stagheight names were recorded as well. For example, Liberty island has more than one sensor in it, but the upper one has represents most of the region.

These were recorded into:
```{r, warning = F, message = F}
stageInfo <- read_csv("E:\\cade\\CommEcolProj\\Data\\ancillary\\StageHeightStation.csv")
stageInfo
```

**Question: Do we want to do something for the overall area?**

### Step 2: Download stageheight information from CDEC

```{r, warning= F, message=F}
# Station IDs previous identified in step 1
stationIDs <- stageInfo$StationID
stationIDs
# study period 
myDates <- c("2014-01-01","2015-12-31")

# create empty cdecData frame
cdecData <- NULL
for (i in 1:length(stationIDs)){
  # Sensor 1 is stageheight
  # Interval is E for event because certain sensors do not aquire data like DSJ unless envt
  test1 <- CDECquery(id = stationIDs[i], sensor = 1, interval = "E", start = myDates[1], 
                    end = myDates[2]) # i,j
  test1$station <- stationIDs[i] #i
  cdecData <- rbind(cdecData,test1)
}

# note that the cdec data according to http://cdec.water.ca.gov/queryCSV.html
# NOTE: Data is displayed in 4-digit year format.
# Dates, times, and output will always be Pacific Standard Time.

```

*Example Extracted data*
```{r,warning= F, message=F}
head(cdecData)
```


### Step 3: Load in aquistion times for Landsat 8 images and edit cdec station times

*Convert cdec datetime to GMT time to match L8*
Currently there is no time zone listed in the cdec query so we need to change this to PST time then to GMT
```{r, warning= F, message=F}
# clean up cdecData query results
cdecData <- cdecData %>% as.tibble() %>% 
  # force datetime to zone pacific
  mutate(datetime = force_tz(datetime, tzone="US/Pacific")) %>% 
  # change date time to GMT to match that of L8 aqusitions
  mutate(datetime_gmt = with_tz(datetime, tzone = "GMT")) %>%
  # join Station ID information to keep studyArea and class intact 
  inner_join(stageInfo, by = c("station" = "StationID"))

# write out cdecData 
##### date written May 28 2018
#write_csv(cdecData, "./Data/ancillary/cdecStageHeightValues.csv")
#### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#
# COMPLETED DO NOT RE-RUN ####

```

*Example filtered data*
```{r, warning= F, message=F}
# show table
head(cdecData)
```

**READ IN CDEC FILE**
```{r, warning = F, message=F}
# read cdec csv
# remove PST time zone
cdecData <- read_csv("./Data/ancillary/cdecStageHeightValues.csv") %>% select(-datetime)
```

*L8 aquistions* 
```{r, warning = F}
# read in L8 aquisition times file 
L8Aq <- read_csv("./Data/ancillary/L8_times.csv") %>%
  # create a single datetime column with lubridate 
  mutate(datetime = ymd_hms(paste(Date, AquTime))) %>%
  # copy datetime column for matching below
  mutate(datetime2 = datetime)

# note that according to https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/landsat_dictionary.html#start_time
# the times of aquistion are recorded in GMT time 

#Example
head(L8Aq)

```

#### Step 4: Match Station aquistions to closest Landsat 8 time

```{r, warning = F} 
# group cdec information by station and nest 
cdecDataNest <- cdecData %>% 
  group_by(station) %>% 
  nest()

#Example 
head(cdecDataNest)

# apply matchClosest function to each dataframe 
# *** function was created for this dataset not generalized yet 
# and unnest
cdecFinal <- cdecDataNest %>%
  mutate(data = map(cdecDataNest$data,matchClosest, sat = L8Aq, 
                    satKey = "datetime2", cdecKey ="datetime_gmt")) %>% 
  unnest()

##write_csv(cdecFinal,"./Data/ancillary/cdecDataFinal.csv")
##### date written May 28 2018
#### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#
# COMPLETED DO NOT RE-RUN ####

# example cdecFinal dataset that is matched to L8data
head(cdecFinal)
```

### Step 5: Create final dataset 
**Merge L8 area dataset and Stageheight extraction**

**Read in area plots**
```{r, warning = F}
# read cdecFinal
cdecFinal <- read_csv("./Data/ancillary/cdecDataFinal.csv")

# area directory
areaDir <- "./Output/AreaCalc_Apr29"

# list area calculation files
areaList <- list.files( areaDir, patter = ".csv$")
# remove shurtiw water ways
areaList <- areaList[!areaList %in% "shruti_waterways_merge.csv"]
areaList <- lapply(paste0(areaDir, "/",areaList), read_csv)
allArea <- do.call("bind_rows",areaList) %>% select(-c(X1)) 

# write the landcovers correctly
# ! check revalue function for cleanear version
landCoverTib <- tibble( landcover = c(1L,2L,3L,4L),
                        landcoverName = c("EMR","FLT","SAV","Water"))
allArea2 <- allArea %>% left_join(landCoverTib,  by = c("landcover" = "landcover"))

# remove x from names
names(allArea2) <- sub("X","",names(allArea2))

# melt to correct format
meltArea <- melt(allArea2)
meltArea <- na.omit(meltArea)
names(meltArea) <- c("StudyArea","Landcover","Date","Area")

#### FINAL STEP ####
# merge area calculations and stage height
allData <- merge(cdecFinal, meltArea, by.x = c("Date", "StudyArea"), by.y = c("Date","StudyArea"))
#change name to stageheight ~! should have done earlier
names(allData)[6] <- "stageheight"

## write to CSV
#write_csv(allData, "./Data/ancillary/classAreaAndStageheight.csv")
##### date written May 28 2018
#### ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#
# COMPLETED DO NOT RE-RUN ##

```


*Example Final dataset used for plotting*
```{r}
head(allData)
```


### Step 6: Plot changes over time 

```{r}
# read in complete dataset
allData <- read_csv("./Data/ancillary/classAreaAndStageheight.csv")  %>% 
  # change date into a Dateformat
  mutate(Date = ymd(Date)) %>%
  # group by station
  group_by(station) %>%
  # nest
  nest()

# Plot using plotSH function
# *** function was created for this dataset not generalized yet 

## !! ask Erin how to then label the names of the plots with the stations and the study areas
myPlots <- map(allData$data,plotSH)

# could also do correlation plots
names(myPlots) <- allData$station

# need to figure out how to label this 
head(allData)
```


### Step 7: Alternative plotting
Modify dataset so that can plot stageheight and area on the same graph.
stageheight will then become its own class

```{r}
# create alternate dataset
# from cdecFinal edit to match that of the Area dataframe
cdecCrop <- cdecFinal %>% 
  # select information for plotting
  select(station, StudyArea, value, Date) %>% 
  # rename the station column to Landcover
  # rename value (stageheight in feet) to Area
  dplyr::rename(Landcover = station, Area = value) %>%
  # change date to a date classe
  mutate(Date = ymd(Date)) %>%
  # filter for just the mainstation
  filter(!Landcover== "MAL",!Landcover== "SJJ",!Landcover== "LIB" , !Landcover == "FAL") %>%
  # change name to stageheight for plotting purposes so that the discrete color matches up
  # previously they were the name 
  mutate(Landcover = "stageheight")


# example dataset
head(cdecCrop)
```

```{r, warning = F}
# melt the area dataset
meltArea <- as.tibble(meltArea) %>% mutate(Date = ymd(Date)) 
```


```{r}
# bind the cropped cdec data to the melted area data
modifiedData <- bind_rows(cdecCrop, meltArea) %>%
  # remove NAs
  na.omit() %>%  
  # group by the subareas
  group_by(StudyArea) %>%
  # nest
  nest()

head(modifiedData)
```






```{r}
# modified plotting
plotMod <- function(df){
  #filter the dataframe to exclude water
    plotArea <- df %>% filter(!Landcover == "Water" ) %>% 
      # plot area vs. date and color by landcover
    ggplot(aes(x = Date, y = Area, col = Landcover)) +
    geom_point() + geom_line() +scale_x_date(breaks = pretty_breaks(10)) + 
    scale_y_continuous( name ="Area (km^2)" ) +  # breaks = seq(0, 10, by = 2) 
    scale_color_manual(values=c("#FFAA00", "#C500FF", "#55FF00","#0070FF")) +
    theme_classic()
    plotArea
}

myPlots <- map(modifiedData$data,plotMod)
myPlots

```

### Step 8: Plot correlation

!!!! need to FINISH 

```{r,eval = F}
plotScatter <- function(x){
  
}

test <- allData$data[[1]]
test.filt <- test %>% filter(Landcover == "SAV") 
plot(test.filt$stageheight,test.filt$Area)

```


###### random notes
```{r, eval = F }
# for plotting also attempted
grid.arrange(plotSH, plotArea, nrow=2, ncol=1)
# 
library(cowplot)
plot_grid(plotSH, plotArea, labels=c("Stageheight", "area"), ncol = 1, nrow = 2)

# but both had uneven plot widths

# above was used to find egg
